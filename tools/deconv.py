"""
Helper module for working with PSF deconvolution algorithms.

- The main purpose is to deconvolve raw EUV images as part of the
  image reduction pipeline (raw -> h5)

- Currently this module interfaces with the SGP deconvolution
  method used by Caplan et al. 2016
  - Here we assume a binary SGP CUDA code is installed on a remote machine
    and the interface works by reading/writing files in the special
    unformatted binary format and sending it to/from the remote machine.
  - NOTE: SGP data formats are UNFORMATTED --> architecture dependent
    - most machines (intel linux/mac) seem to work but this is NOT GUARANTEED

- ToDo: integrate an open source GPU deconvolution package so we can abandon SGP
