# Coronal Hole Detection and Modeling

Methods based on [CHMAP](https://zenodo.org/record/5039440) from Predictive Science Inc. (PSI) 

## [Carrington Map CHD]:
- download files from time period of interest
- prepare images for algorithm
- loop through maps to create minimum merge composite map
  - apply PSI's EZSEG algorithm for coronal hole detection
  - combine maps using PSI's minimum merge mapping techniques
